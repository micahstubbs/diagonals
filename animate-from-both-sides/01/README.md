this iteration makes the code nice to work with, for my subjective definition of "nice"

- js in index.js file
- prettier format js
- update js with lebab
- single quotes in html
- no line breaks in html

Someone just wanted to make a grid of squares animate in diagonally. This takes a series of numbers and maps them to rows and columns using [triangular numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number). (It mightâ€™ve been more straightforward to just [invert the Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Inverting_the_Cantor_pairing_function).)

I added little fractions text, so it doubles as a visual proof of [the countability of the rationals](http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/rational-numbers-countable.php)! And then I made two, so it doubles as a visual proof of the fact that [the sum of consecutive triangular numbers is a square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number#Relations_to_other_figurate_numbers)!

Refresh for a different pair of consecutive triangle numbers.
